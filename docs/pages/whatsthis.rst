what's this?
==================

I want to make PDF using Sphinx at many time, but TeXLive environment
is so huge and complicated to install, especially Windows.

Menes is PDF generator from your sphinx project. By using menes, you
never need to install TeX environment.


Privacy concern
----------------------------

Menes code is open at `github <http:///github.com/shirou/menes>`_ and
I guarantee to see posted files. But you may not believe. If so, You
can create your own menes server.
